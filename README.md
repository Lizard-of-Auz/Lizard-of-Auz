- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python (Python3 to be specific, Java, C, app developement, and git.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really as long as i find whatever it is within my capacity to do so as to not unintentionally affect any project negatively.
- 📫 How to reach me, check my onlyfans.... just kidding lmaao anyone is more than welcome to reach out on discord (Shane_Lizard) Cserver is plug in dis cord) or telegram (Lizard_of_Auz)
- Fun Fact: Im currently going through getting certified so ican start a programming career, as well as an amatuer adult media actorm(not bragging just figured so that way i can warn you who to avoid lmao), and previously I worked as an Aircraft mechanic and the big dinger of it all- IM ONLY 23! ... but feel 50
- I plan to have any starter/simplistic/basic projects that i start in this repo once i start learning enough to really try it out.
